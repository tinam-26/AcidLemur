# AcidLemur
Thank you for playing Cat-ch 'Em All, brought to you by
Sara Ashcraft, Sean Kelly, Christina Modica, and Sandra Wiktor
of Acid Lemur Studios!

The goal is simple: catch one of every type of cat.
You'll need to move around the map and solve puzzles to catch some of them.

Here are the controls:

Arrow keys - movement
W - attempt catch
E - scare away
